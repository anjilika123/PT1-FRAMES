<h2>?? Breakfast</h2>
<h3>1. Pancakes</h3>
<p><b><i>Ingredients:</i></b> Flour, sugar, Baking Powder, Milk or Non-Dairy Milk, Egg, Butter, and Vanilla Extract</p>

<p><b><i>Steps:</i></b>
<ol>
<li><b>Prepare the butter:</b> Melt the butter and set it aside to cool slightly.</li>

<li><b>Combine dry ingredients:</b> In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>

<li><b>Combine wet ingredients:</b> In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Don’t worry if the butter solidifies a little.</li>

<li><b>Mix the batter:</b> Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour the milk mixture into the well and gently whisk until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are perfectly normal. As the batter rests, you should see it begin to bubble. It will be thick, like cake batter. If it seems too thick, add a splash more milk to thin it out.</li>

<li><b>Preheat the skillet:</b> Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. To check if it’s ready, sprinkle a few drops of water on the surface. They should “dance” around and evaporate quickly.</li>

<li><b>Cook the pancakes:</b> Brush the skillet with melted butter for crispy edges (you can skip this if using a good nonstick pan). Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or a large cookie scoop, then gently spread each pancake into a 4-inch circle.</li>


<li><b>Flip the pancakes:</b> After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until they’re lightly browned and cooked through. Enjoy your pancakes right away with warm syrup, more butter, and berries.</li>
</ol>

<p><b><i>2.Ham and Cheese Sliders</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Ingredients:</i></b> Hawaiian sweet rolls, Ham, Swiss cheese, Butter, and Horseradish sauce
Chopped onion</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Cut the rolls, and fill:</b> Grease a 9-inch square baking pan. Remove the entire loaf of rolls from the bag, and cut them in half horizontally without separating the rolls. Spread the horseradish over the roll bottoms. Layer with ham and cheese, and replace the roll tops.</li>
<li><b>Make the butter topping:</b> In a small skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until tender, one to two minutes. Stir in the brown sugar, spicy brown mustard, poppy seeds, Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder.</li>
<li><b>Pour and chill:</b> Pour the butter topping over the prepared rolls. Cover the baking pan with aluminum foil, and refrigerate the rolls for several hours or overnight.</li>
<li><b>Time to bake:</b>Remove the rolls from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking, and preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake the rolls, covered, for 25 minutes. Uncover the rolls and bake an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm.</li>
